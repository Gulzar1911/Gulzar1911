-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gulzar1911
-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about CFD code development, numerical modelling, and artificial intelligence.
-ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m delving into open-source tools while researching datacenter thermal modelling. Iâ€™m integrating machine learning to predict and estimate the optimal temperatures.
- Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on high-performance computing projects for CFD problems.

-ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
-âš¡ Fun fact: Give me an interesting problem, and I'm all in!

I hold a master's degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering, specializing in Advanced Partial Differential Equations, 
Machine Learning, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. With extensive experience using ANSYS and COMSOL, Iâ€™m now expanding my 
horizons with open-source software. My work spans Multiphase Fluid Flow, Complex Air Flows in Data Center Rooms, and Material Modelling.

When Iâ€™m not untangling complex airflow dynamics, you might find me on a quest for the perfect coffee blend to fuel my next big idea. 
Let's tackle some challenging problems togetherâ€”expect a sprinkle of humor along the way! ðŸ˜„
