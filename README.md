Hi, I’m @Gulzar1911,
I’m passionate about CFD code development, numerical modelling of multiphysics problems and machine learning.
Currently, I’m delving into open-source tools while researching datacenter thermal modelling. I’m integrating machine learning to predict and estimate the optimal parameters to increase efficiency of Datacenters. I’m eager to collaborate on high-performance / parallel computing projects of CFD.

-⚡ Fun fact: Give me an interesting problem, and I'm all in!

I hold a master's degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering, with electives in Advanced Partial Differential Equations, 
Machine Learning, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. With extensive experience using ANSYS and COMSOL, I’m now expanding my 
horizons with open-source tools. My work spans Multiphase Fluid Flow, Complex fluid Flows, and Numerical Modelling.
