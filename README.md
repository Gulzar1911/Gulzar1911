-👋 Hi, I’m @Gulzar1911
-👀 I’m passionate about CFD code development, numerical modelling, and artificial intelligence.
-🌱 Currently, I’m delving into open-source tools while researching datacenter thermal modelling. I’m integrating machine learning to predict and estimate the optimal temperatures.
-💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on high-performance computing projects for CFD problems.
-📫 How to reach me: gulzarali05@gmail.com
-😄 Pronouns: ...
-⚡ Fun fact: Give me an interesting problem, and I'm all in!

I hold a master's degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering, specializing in Advanced Partial Differential Equations, 
Machine Learning, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. With extensive experience using ANSYS and COMSOL, I’m now expanding my 
horizons with open-source software. My work spans Multiphase Fluid Flow, Complex Air Flows in Data Center Rooms, and Material Modelling.

When I’m not untangling complex airflow dynamics, you might find me on a quest for the perfect coffee blend to fuel my next big idea. 
Let's tackle some challenging problems together—expect a sprinkle of humor along the way! 😄
