Hi, I’m Gulzar Ali,
I’m passionate about CFD code development, numerical modelling of multiphysics problems and machine learning.
Currently, I’m delving into open-source tools while learning CFD + ML methods introduced for complex problems. My research mainly includes CFD of multiphase flows, thermal characterizations and airflow modelling in datacentre, FEA/FVM Codes, Numerical Modelling, Computational Aeronautics. I’m integrating machine learning methods to predict and estimate the optimal parameters to increase the efficiency of Datacentres in my master's thesis. I’m eager to collaborate on high-performance / parallel computing projects of CFD.

-⚡ Fun fact: Give me an interesting problem, and I'm all in!

I hold a master's degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering, with electives in Advanced Partial Differential Equations, 
Machine Learning, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. With extensive experience using ANSYS and COMSOL, I’m now expanding my 
horizons with open-source tools and Deep learning methods.
